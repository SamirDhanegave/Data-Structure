# Data-Structure

one or more elements. non linear data structure is divided into 2 types.
*trees: it is one type of non linear data structure. it is a collection of nodes and
edges. there will be unique node called root in tree. tree is a hierarchical model.
it always contain n-1 edges.
*graph: it is one type of non linear data structure. it is collection of vetices and
edges. there will be no unique node called root in graph. graph is a network model.
it contain no. of edges depending upon graph.
*ABSTRACT DATA TYPE:
A) abstract data type is a mathematical model that logically represents a datatype.
abstract datatype only tells you the essential features without including background
details. it specifies set of data and set of operation that can be performed on the
data. this is also called information hiding. it is a logical description of how we
view data and operation without respective of how they will be implemented. the
implementation of abstract data type, often referred as a data type.
*SPARSE MATRICES.
A) it is a two dimensional data object which is made by m rows and n columns, so
that we can say the number of data value in spares matrix are m and n. in any
matrix, the element have 0 value are more than the others elements called a sparse
matrix.
 ADVANTAGES:
 *storage: as we know sparse matrix contain lesser non zero elements than zero so
less memory can be used to store elements. it evaluates only the non zero elements.
 *computing time: computing time can be saved by logically designing ds traversing
only non zero elements.
SPARSE MATRIX REPRESENTATION: the non zero elements can be stored with triples. i.e;
row, column, and value. it can be representated in following way.
